# Do.

Wake up early.

Show up.

Learn how to think.

Be genuine, but appear nice.

Use envy for motivation instead of destruction.

Do what you say youâ€™re going to do.

Ensure balance in every area of your life.

Confront repressed thoughts immediately.

Surround yourself with people who are better than you (but remember the thing about envy).

Work out every day.

Be good at what you do.

Make money doing what you love.

Have good friends.

Never settle.
